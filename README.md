## Introduction

Grid layouts are a fundamental part of modern web design, allowing you to create organized and responsive web pages. This project provides a basic structure for a grid layout using HTML and CSS.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the web page. It includes a container div and two child divs with grid classes (`grid1` and `grid2`). Inside `grid1`, there is a navigation bar with buttons and an image.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) contains styling rules for the HTML elements. It defines the layout of the grid, the appearance of buttons, and the positioning of the image. The CSS code provides a simple and clean visual style for the grid structure.

## Usage

You can use this code as a starting point for creating your grid-based web pages. Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS to suit your specific design needs. Grid layouts are highly customizable, and this repository provides a basic structure to build upon.

To use this code, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the grid layout in action.
